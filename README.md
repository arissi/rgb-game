[RGB Guessing Challenge](http://www.rgbchallenge.com/) clone.
You are given six random colors and three numerical values for Red, Green, and Blue—an RGB code. Based on that code, you have to choose the correct color value from the six choices.

# Motivation

Wanted to build an app with some moving pieces, html, styling, DOM manipulation, and event handling. It's also nice tool to practice rgb colors since the rgb color system is a little unintuitive at first.
